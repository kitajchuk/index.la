# ABOUT THIS FILE
#
# In conjunction with a properly configured Circle CI build, this file
# will deploy a static build from Circle to a remote host of your
# choosing for every branch that is pushed to Github.
#
# To use it, add the following command to your circle.yml file:
#
# make -ef Circlefile deploy
#
# Note that this file is actually a *Makefile* masquerading as a
# "Circlefile". That"s why to run these tasks you"ll need to pass the
# "-f" flag and identify this file explicitly.
#
# By default, variables defined within a Makefile override environment
# variable values. This file is designed with the opposite principle in
# mind -- i.e. that the sane defaults are set explicitly here, any of
# which can be overridden via environment variables.
#
# To ensure this behavior, make sure to run this file with the `-e`
# flag.


# REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#
# The following environment variables must be defined in order for the
# make tasks in this file to execute properly. Most of these are
# already defined by Circle CI during each build.
#
# GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
# An access token for this projects repository that has permission
# to get/post to the Github Status API. Set this value in the Circle
# CI admin under Project Settings > Tweaks > Environment Variables
#
# CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME
# The username or organization name of the project being tested, i.e.
# "foo" in circleci.com/gh/foo/bar/123. Available by default in
# Circle CI build.
#
# CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME
# The repository name of the project being tested, i.e. "bar" in
# circleci.com/gh/foo/bar/123. Available by default in Circle CI
# build.
#
# CIRCLE_BRANCH
# The name of the branch being tested, e.g. "master". Available by
# default in Circle CI build.
#
# CIRCLE_SHA1
# The SHA1 of the commit being tested. Available by default in
# Circle CI build.


# VARIABLES
#
# Note: Run make with the "-e" flag to ensure environment variables
# take precedence over these definitions.


# TARGETS
#
# Deploy to all AWS instances.
